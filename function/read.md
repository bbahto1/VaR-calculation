## Parameters
Parameters in this case are changeable for the desired output. These parameters are: 
1. Number of performed simulations
1. Value of the stock portfolio
1. Stocks that are inside the portfolio
1. Time period for stock observation   

## Parameters inside the code
For this cae and if you want to reproduce the same results first set of parameters are: 
1. Number of performed simulations = 5000
1. Value of the stock portfolio = 10000
1. Stocks = [AAPL, MSFT, GOOG] 
1. Time period for stock observation = 100 days

For this cae and if you want to reproduce the same results second set of parameters are: 
1. Number of performed simulations = 5000
1. Value of the stock portfolio = 10000
1. Stocks = [KO, GOOG, GM] 
1. Time period for stock observation = 100 days
